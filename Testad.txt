Here is an example of Composer code that reads 50 employee IDs from a BigQuery table, fetches details from LDAP, and writes the data to another BigQuery table:
```
# Read employee IDs from BigQuery
read_employee_ids:
  bigquery:
    query: SELECT employee_id FROM source_table LIMIT 50
    destination: employee_ids

# Fetch LDAP details for each employee ID
fetch_ldap_details:
  foreach: employee_ids
  ldap:
    server: ldap_server
    user: ldap_user
    password: ldap_password
    search_base: ou=employees,dc=example,dc=com
    search_filter: (employeeID=${employee_id})
    attributes:
      - employee_name
      - employee_email
    output: ldap_details

# Write LDAP details to BigQuery
write_to_bigquery:
  bigquery:
    table: destination_table
    rows: ldap_details
```
This code uses the `foreach` operator to iterate over the 50 employee IDs, fetches LDAP details for each ID using the `ldap` operator, and writes the data to another BigQuery table using the `bigquery` operator.
Caching in the context of LDAP queries involves storing the results of previous queries to avoid repeating the same query multiple times. Here's a high-level overview of how to achieve caching:

1. *Cache store*: Choose a cache store like Redis, Memcached, or an in-memory cache (e.g., Python's `cachetools` library).
2. *Cache key*: Generate a unique cache key for each LDAP query based on the query parameters (e.g., employee ID, search filter).
3. *Cache query results*: Store the LDAP query results in the cache store using the cache key.
4. *Check cache before querying LDAP*: Before making an LDAP query, check the cache store for a valid cache entry using the cache key.
5. *Return cached results*: If a valid cache entry exists, return the cached results instead of querying LDAP.
6. *Invalidate cache entries*: Implement a cache invalidation strategy (e.g., time-to-live, cache expiration) to remove stale cache entries.

Here's a simple example using Python and the `cachetools` library:
```
import cachetools

# Create a cache with a time-to-live (TTL) of 1 hour
cache = cachetools.TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=3600)

def fetch_ldap_details(employee_id):
    cache_key = f"ldap:{employee_id}"
    if cache_key in cache:
        return cache[cache_key]
    else:
        # Make LDAP query and store results in cache
        ldap_results = make_ldap_query(employee_id)
        cache[cache_key] = ldap_results
        return ldap_results
```
In this example, the `fetch_ldap_details` function checks the cache for a valid entry using the `cache_key`. If an entry exists, it returns the cached results. Otherwise, it makes the LDAP query, stores the results in the cache, and returns the results.

Note: This is a simplified example and may require modifications to suit your specific use case.
Note:

- Replace `source_table`, `destination_table`, `ldap_server`, `ldap_user`, and `ldap_password` with your actual values.
- Adjust the LDAP search filter and attributes to match your specific LDAP schema.
- This code assumes that the LDAP server is accessible from the Composer environment. If not, you may need to use a different approach, such as using a Cloud Function or a separate LDAP client.
