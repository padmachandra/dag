Here’s a clean bullet-point style feedback you can use:

Strong in Java and Spring Boot for backend development

Good proficiency with React for frontend development

Demonstrated full-stack capabilities (frontend + backend)

Aware of deployment procedures using Docker and Kubernetes

Has experience with a few AWS services and could explain them clearly

Communicated technical concepts well during the discussion


Do you also want me to make a “Strengths / Areas to Improve” style version (common in interview feedback forms)?
